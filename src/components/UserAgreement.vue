            WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION,
            COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING
            FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND THESE TERMS OF USE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY
            AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.3. The arbitration will be by a single arbitrator administered by the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration

            (The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)
            The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

            or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered
            to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity.

            as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will have discretion
            to include the payment of your or our arbitration costs and legal fees in any award.
          </p>
          <p>

            CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may
            not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form
            of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider
            the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration
            waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <p>
            13.9 These binding arbitration provisions shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law,
            and if any provision of this Section is found unenforceable in any final, non-appealable decision

            arbitration terms will be enforced, and any portion of any claims or actions which may be resolved
            by arbitration shall be so resolved, subject to all enforceable provisions of this Section.
